- Token Distribution and Community involvement metrics: 
Circulating supply : 10,000,000,000 ANKR or 100.00%
Total supply: 10,000,000,000 ANKR
Max. supply: 10,000,000,000 ANKR
- Token Distribution: 
Total Holders: 44,071
Collectively own: 89.60%

There are some whales, however most of the big holders are exchanges such as Binance and Coinbase. Some exchanges have multiple ANKR adresses (https://etherscan.io/token/tokenholderchart/0x8290333cef9e6d528dd5618fb97a76f268f3edd4)

- Operational Metrics and Community Treasury: 
40% of the tokens are distributed to the node right away in 2017 (https://www.ankr.com/docs/staking-extra/ankr-tokenomics/) 
The rest 60% were unlocked between 2017 and 2022
49% going to individual stakers 
51% allocated to node providers
The Ankr network itself is not a PoS network, but a node network that supports other PoS blockchains. Ankr allows users to deploy nodes on PoS blockchains, 
stake their PoS tokens, and access decentralized finance (DeFi) applications. Current staking APR is %6.29 with around $6 millions staked on delegated staking and 
around $86 millions staked on liquid staking ethereum network with %3.12 APY. 
Cost of a 51% attack would involve acquiring 51% of the token supply, which could drive up the price of the token due to demand. Current supply is 10,000,000,000 and current price is around
0.0253 meaning it would cost 2,530,000,00 which is not feasible, because even exchanges own around 15% max. 

- User Engagement Metrics: 
Top 10 Holders control - 54% of Total Supply
Top 20 Holders control - 64% of Total Supply
Top 50 Holders control - 74% of Total Supply
Top 100 Holders control - 90% of Total Supply

- Transparency and Auditing:
Ankr undergo audit checks starting from 2020 (https://www.ankr.com/docs/staking-extra/audit-reports/). 
Smart contracts, liquid staking, delegated staking and bridges undergo audits. 

-Interoperability:
The number and significance of integrations with other DeFi protocols, wallets, or platforms.
The ability of ANKR to operate or integrate with multiple blockchain networks.

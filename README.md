The objective of this challenge is to generate a comprehensive report that assesses the degree of decentralization in the crypto asset project.

- Choose any cryptocurrency project, whether it is a native coin or a token.
- Create a list of metrics that would help you evaluate how decentralized a project is. Below are a few examples that can help guide you in the right direction. While this list is a good starting point, it is not exhaustive. And it would be advantageous for your submission to include a more comprehensive list of quality metrics.

```
1. GitHub metrics
     - contributor commit activity (number of contributors, percentage of commits from top contributors, etc.)
     - number of pull requests
     - ...
2. Operational metrics
     - allocation/distribution of assets at the initial launch
     - profit mechanism
     - ...
3. Blockchain metrics
     - cost of 51% attack
     - ...
4. ...
```

- Create a report that includes the metrics with values for the project you chose. Don't forget to include a brief 1-2 sentence explanation of each metric.

*Note*: Some metrics might be quantitative, while others - qualitative.
